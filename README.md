📌 Overview

Credit Card Fraud Detection 2.0 is the upgraded version of my original fraud detection project.
This version includes a complete React + TypeScript frontend, ML-powered prediction engine, CSV batch fraud analysis, and an interactive analytics dashboard.

The system predicts whether a transaction is SAFE or FRAUD, assigns a risk level, and calculates a confidence score using a custom ML pipeline + Gemini API.
